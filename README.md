# USER DOCUMENTATION :

The algorithm enables written text to be translated into Morse code on a .wav audio file, and vice versa. Written text can be entered via a .txt file, or directly from the keyboard.

Please note that not all characters are available. Allowed characters are: letters of the Latin alphabet, upper and lower case; numbers from 0 to 9; the following punctuation characters: . , ? ! / ( ) : ; -
Note that letters with accents, รง, apostrophes and quotation marks are not available.

When the terminal asks you to enter a file name, enter a file in the indicated format (.txt or .wav), without specifying .txt or .wav at the end of the file name (enter "file_name" and not "file_name.txt").

This folder contains 2 test .wav audio files, and 5 test .txt files (their translation into Morse code audio has not been added to this folder as they are too large).

A Makefile is used to compile the various functions.
